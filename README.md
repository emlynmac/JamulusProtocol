# JamulusProtocol

Jamulus (https://jamulus.io) is a low-latency open-source audio mixing client-server application.

This module implements the protocol signalling library in Swift.

It is very much a work-in-progress, meaning frequent changes and many features not yet implemented.

Here be dragons.
